# DSIKProject1
This repository contains a source code of a small university project I've been making. It consists of three vital parts:
Server App (C#), Client App (C#) and SocketSupport dynamic library (C). The main idea was to allow a simple communication between the Server and the Client applications over TCP protocol and to give a simple ability of sending files over that protocol. Destination platform is Windows only.
